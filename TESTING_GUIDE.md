# Manual Testing Guide for Player Management Changes

## Setup
1. Start the development server: `npm start`

- Player list still shows only 3 slots
- All 3 players remain in activePlayers

3. Play several turns
4. Add a 3rd player mid-game

**Expected Results:**
- 3rd player sees current game state
- 3rd player is added to turn rotation
- Next time it would be their turn, they can play
- Game continues smoothly

## Verification Checklist

For each test case, verify:
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors
- [ ] Turn indicator shows correct player's turn
- [ ] Dice can only be rolled by current turn player
- [ ] Tokens can only be moved by current turn player
- [ ] Turn advances correctly to next active player
- [ ] No turns are wasted on non-joined players
- [ ] Player list shows correct number of slots
- [ ] Inactive players show "(Waiting)" status
- [ ] Room capacity is enforced correctly

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Turn Stuck:** If turns don't advance, check:
   - activePlayers array is populated
   - currentTurn is not null
   - getNextPlayer is using activePlayers correctly

2. **Wrong Player Count:** If seeing 4 players when 2 selected:
   - Check numPlayers is passed correctly
   - Verify createInitialGameState receives numPlayers
   - Check player list slicing logic

3. **Can Join Full Room:** If able to join full room:
   - Check isRoomFull logic in LiveRooms.js
   - Verify room capacity check in App.js
   - Check activePlayers.length vs numPlayers

## Debug Information

To see detailed logs:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for log messages with emojis:
   - üé≤ Dice rolls
   - ‚úÖ Successful operations
   - ‚ùå Errors or invalid moves
   - ‚è≠Ô∏è Turn changes
   - üèÜ Win condition

## Performance Check

Monitor Firestore operations:
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Firestore Database
3. Check read/write counts
4. Verify no unnecessary updates

Expected operations per turn:
- 1 write for dice roll
- 1 write for token move
- Real-time listener updates on all clients

## Cleanup

After testing:
1. Delete test rooms from Firebase Console
2. Or use the üóëÔ∏è button in Live Rooms panel
3. Clear browser cache if needed
